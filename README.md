Nothing special to see here, just some kids on a fairly boring project to understand the basics of backend.
A local online directory that lists resources (essential or non-essential) in a particular area.
Primary focus on making the website as lightweight and clean as possible.

Instructions to run in Xampp:
Donwload all the files.
Make a new folder called project under htdocs and transfer all these files as is.
Import the 'essential' and 'nonessen' files in phpmyadmin under a database named 'info_for_directory'.
Import the 'users_registry' file as a whole database.
BE VERY CAREFUL OF THE NAMES AND TRY NOT TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES WHILE SPELLING.
Run via localhost/project/title.php
